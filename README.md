We tried to get the python instance to be the backend to manage the player and ship classes but ran out of time to get this working. We instead are using JS and player.js to manage these features. We didn't want to exclude this file as our team worked hard on it but is now depreciated.

  Sets the player ID and intial ships for the player object

  Given a coordinate, returns if the attack is a miss, hit or sink as well as the ship if hit

- **`Player - attack(otherPlayer, cord)`**:
  Calls check_pos against another player

- **`Ship - __init__(type, pos)`**:
  Defines the type of ship instantied which sets the name and hp while the position is set from the frontend
